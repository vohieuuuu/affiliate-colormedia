Next Steps for Implementation:
Database Schema Update:

Add fields for accumulated_commission, current_level, monthly_contract_value.

Automated KPI Tracking:

System should track contacts/leads and check KPI at the end of the month.

Level-Up Automation:

If contract value threshold is met, auto-update level in the next month.

API Development:

Ensure /api/commission/add-bonus integrates with the commission system.
